Data:

To answer this research question I will be using foursquare API data to get data on neighborhoods similar to that used in Segmenting and Clustering lab from week 3. 
Then I will merge this with data from nychealth that provides the number of cases and deaths sorted by neighborhood. 
After doing this I will calculate the distance to the nearest hospital for each neighborhood by using foursquare API data and measure the relationship between the death rate and distance to nearest hospital.
The dataset can be found at this link: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/data-by-modzcta.csv
